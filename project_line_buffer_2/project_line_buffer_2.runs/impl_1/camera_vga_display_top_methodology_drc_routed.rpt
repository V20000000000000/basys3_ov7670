DPIR-1#17 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP vga_control/read_RAM_address_reg0 input pin vga_control/read_RAM_address_reg0/C[6] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

DPIR-1#18 Warning

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clock_PLL_100_50_25MHz/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_clock_PLL_100_50_25MHz, clkfbout_clock_PLL_100_50_25MHz_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clock_PLL_100_50_25MHz/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT1 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out2_clock_PLL_100_50_25MHz, clk_out2_clock_PLL_100_50_25MHz_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#3 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clock_PLL_100_50_25MHz/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT2 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out3_clock_PLL_100_50_25MHz, clk_out3_clock_PLL_100_50_25MHz_1
